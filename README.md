My biohacking @De Waag projects

The goal of this project is to create a slime mold racetrack... testing out different slime molds to race against each other, different race tracks, and see the behavior of the species to different environments. 

We want to publish the progress and results of the race on a website with a live cam.

Possibly allow people to design & submit their own racetracks and cultures to do a deathmatch.
